## Design data structures and algorithms for in-memory file system

Design a simple in memory file system. 

A file system, in its most simplistic version, consists of Files and Directories. Each Directory contains a 
set of Files and Directories. Since Files and Directories share so many characteristics, you can implement them such that they can inherit from a super class.
